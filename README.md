# Machine Learning Algorithms
Implementations of machine learning algorithms

## Includes
- Neural Network
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Radial Basis Function Network
- Perceptron (linear regression)

## Results
Plots of decision regions for classifying digits 1 versus not 1 are shown below. Average intensity and symmetry were two features that were computed from the raw image data. In each case, regularization and cross validation was used.
